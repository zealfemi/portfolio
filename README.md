         "Details about yourself. You can include HTML tags for formatting.",
     };
     ```

     ```javascript
     export const skills = [
       { name: "React", icon: <React /> },
       { name: "JavaScript", icon: <JavaScript /> },
       // Add more skills as needed
     ];
     ```

   - Add or update your projects in the `projects` array:

     export const projects = [
       {
         title: "Project Title",

       },
       // Add more projects as needed
     ];
     ```

2. **Change Theme Colors:**

   - Open the `tailwind.config.js` file and update the `colors` object to customize the theme:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       theme: {
         extend: {
           colors: {
             primary: "#D3E97A", // Replace with your primary color
             secondary: "#222222", // Replace with your secondary color
             dark: "#0A0A0A", // Replace with your dark color
           },
         },
       },
     };
     ```

3. **Replace Images:**

   - Replace default images in the `/public` folder:
     - `image.jpg`: Replace this with your profile photo.
     - Project images: Replace `project1.png`, `project2.png`, etc., with screenshots of your projects.
   - Update the `image` field in the `projects` array to match the new image paths.

4. **Modify Other Static Assets:**

   - Replace or update icons located in the `src/assets` folder to match your branding or style.

5. **Connect Your Formspree Account:**
   - To connect your own Formspree account, replace the value in the `formspreeEndpoint` with the endpoint provided in your Formspree dashboard:
     ```javascript
     export const formspreeEndpoint = "your-formspree-endpoint";
     ```
   - You can find this endpoint in your Formspree dashboard after setting up the form.
